            <h4>Welcome Back to School!<img id="first-image" class="newsletter-image" src="images/KN Aug 2021_CAO Message.jpg" /></h4>
            <p>Welcome to the 2021–22 school year! Ambitious Instruction: Accelerating Learning will be our focus and will bring the district back to the basics of high-quality learning and teaching.</p>
            <p>Closing the opportunity gap in reading, writing, and mathematics remains priority work for the district. Ambitious Instruction: Accelerating Learning explicitly acknowledges the key role that all content areas play in ensuring that students acquire essential knowledge, skills, and dispositions for school, college, career, and community success. It unites all content areas around formative practices, explicit instruction, and meaningful student engagement. Each grade level and content area will embrace specific instructional practices in these areas.</p>
            <p>Our success requires that all departments in the Office of Academics focus on Ambitious Instruction. By pulling together, we will support teachers while meeting state and local compliance laws. Students in alternative education programs, advanced academics, and dual enrollment will also be positively impacted by Ambitious Instruction.</p>
            <p>During leadership institutes, along with the input of the Office of School Administration and the Department of Research, Assessment, and Data, the Office of Academics has supported school leaders with Educator Effectiveness to help develop school goals and follow school improvement plans. Throughout the school year, topics of these institutes will include content areas, using data, incorporating social-emotional learning, walk-through tools, strategies, look-fors in classrooms, building school communities around academics, equity, before- and after-school supports, and much more—all through a leadership lens.</p>
            <p>Upcoming teacher institute sessions will focus on all content areas, including early childhood, world languages, and STEM. We will also continue to offer sessions for teachers and those who support teachers—such as SSTs, PSTs, and school counselors—and show educators their role in Ambitious Instruction.</p>
            <p>By following the Ambitious Instruction roadmap, we will provide students with the necessary supports in classrooms and prepare them for college and/or career after graduating from Milwaukee Public Schools.</p>
            <p>Enjoy your school year.</p>
            <p>Respectfully,</p>
            <p>Jennifer Mims-Howell
                <br />
                Chief Academic Officer

            <p>On July 26, 2021, the official ribbon-cutting ceremony for the GE Innovation Labs took place. The six labs located across the district were made possible by a $1.8 million donation by GE. Teachers and administrators from the six schools receiving a lab also participated in a two-day professional development provided by devX to help them maximize the effectiveness of the labs.
